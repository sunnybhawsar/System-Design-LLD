### Requirements:

Low level design for a Generic Cache that should support following operations:
* **Put**: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache.
* **Get**: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
* **Eviction**: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.

    > LRU: Least Recently Used
    
    > LFU: Least Frequenctly Used

### Expectations
* Code should be functionally correct.
* Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional level code.
* Code should be extensible and scalable. Means it should be able to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
* Code should have good OOPs design.
